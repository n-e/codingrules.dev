# Loops should have an easy to reason about termination condition

Infinite loops can have harmful consequences, such as blocking the browser tab,
making a server unresponsive or consuming a huge amount of resources.

When writing a loop, make sure that it's obvious the loop terminates.

## Example: simple search

❌ Don't:

```js
let found = null;
while (found === null) {
  const next = items.getNextElement();
  if (next === "expected") found = next;
}
```

Although the above code is correct if `"expected"` always exists in `items`, it
isn't obvious when reading the code that this invariant is true. Furthermore, as
the code is changed, this invariant may cease to be true and an infinite loop
may occur.

✅ Do:

```js
let found = null;
while (const item of items) {
  if (item === "expected") {
    found = item;
    break;
  }
}
```

## Example: shortening a paragraph until its height matches the expected height

❌ Don't:

```js
function shorten(paragraph, style, maxHeight) {
  const el = document.createElement("p");
  el.style = style;
  el.innerText = paragraph;

  while (el.offsetHeight > maxHeight) {
    paragraph = paragraph.slice(0, -1);
    el.innerText = paragraph;
  }

  return paragraph;
}
```

Although when testing it the above code may seem to work, it is not obvious that the paragraph will become lower than maxHeight even if it is a few characters long.

✅ Do:

```js
function shorten(paragraph, style, maxHeight, minLength = 10) {
  const el = document.createElement("p");
  el.style = style;
  el.innerText = paragraph;

  while (el.offsetHeight > maxHeight && p.length > minLength) {
    paragraph = paragraph.slice(0, -1);
    el.innerText = paragraph;
  }

  return paragraph;
}
```

**Note:** in real-world scenarios, the examples above are slow and overly complicated, and most scenarios will be better solved with CSS styling.
