# Don't use unnecessary conditionals (if, switch...)

When a piece of code contains an `if` condition, the code can take 2 paths. If
the piece of code contains two nested `if` conditions, the code can take 4. If
there are three the code can take 8 paths.

Each of these paths can hide a bug. The fewer conditionals there are, the fewer
edge cases there are, and the more likely it is to come across the bugs when
testing.

## Example: handling a 0-length array

❌ Don't:

```ts
async function getData(ids: string[]) {
  if (ids.length === 0) return [];
  if (ids.length === 1) return [await db.findOne(ids[0])];
  return db.find(ids);
}
```

In this example, the code may behave differently whether there is 0, 1, or more
elements, and will need to have three tests to make sure it works properly.

The three cases may also have subtle differences that will not be detected while
testing but may cause a bug in production.

✅ Do:

```ts
async function getData(ids: string[]) {
  return db.find(ids);
}
```
